               One Statement, Many Variables

                  You can declare many variables in one statement.
                  Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:

                     let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
        */



        /*
        Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables
         If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.

        The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:

        Example:
         var carName = "Volvo";
         var carName;
